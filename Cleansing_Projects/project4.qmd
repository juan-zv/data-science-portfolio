__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

classifier_DT = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=11)


classifier_DT.fit(X_train, y_train)


y_pred = classifier_DT.predict(X_test)

```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.__
