## Whis is it important to have a portfolio?

__Having a data science portfolio is essential for showing off your skills and experience in the field. It's like a showcase of your real-world problem-solving abilities with data, making you stand out to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It's also a great way to track your progress and growth over time, helping you snag job opportunities and move forward in your data science career.__
